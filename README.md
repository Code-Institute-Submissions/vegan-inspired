# Vegan Inspired

Vegan Inspired is an online application which allow everyone to contribute in vegan inspired collection of racips.
User can add, edit, and delete racips. However, Vegan Inspired works more as a collection of ideas, quick links, rather than recips themselves.
Full recips being attached as a link on the bottom of every card. This app's goal is to connect people who are interested
in vegan diet, build the collection of recips and get inspired by others.  

## UX

Vegan Inspired has an informative purpose.
It provides sets of quick links for inspiration.

User can not only read through and go to other coulinary pages thanks to the links attached
but also add their own cards, delete and edit the others.
